# Mojo

Mojo is a collection of interprocess communication technologies, protocols and
a runtime for creating applications and services that are composable while
being loosely coupled. It simplifies the creation of fully asynchronous
component-based systems and provides guarantees so that components made by
different vendors and in different programming languages can interoperate.
